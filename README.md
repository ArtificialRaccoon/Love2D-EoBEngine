# Love2D-EoBEngine
A First Person, 2D Maze Engine in the style of Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master, etc.  Incomplete, but the following is possible:

* Display of (currently non-)interactable NPCs (which can be visible from predefined perspectives)
* Player Teleportation
* Transition into "Battlemode"
* Full Rendering of the Maze
* Minimap
* Mouse Control for the Navigation Buttons

The rest (what would make this a game, among other things) is completely unimplimented right now.
